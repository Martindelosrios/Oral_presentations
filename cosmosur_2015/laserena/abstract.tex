Title : Merging Systems Identification in Systems of Galaxies
Abstract
The Bullet Cluster and many other examples of merging systems provided observational evidence for the existence of dark matter. Most of them have been used to test the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) paradigm itself. The presence of DM and constraints on its self-interaction cross section can therefore be inferred by measuring a spatial offset between the X-ray emission of the ICM plasma and its total mass distribution.
Using a combination of test (Dressler Schectman (1988) and Mixture of Gaussians) designed to detect substructures, we are able to define samples of merging systems with high levels of completitude, low contamination and almost exact definition of the center position. Using simulated SDSS galaxy catalogs we could known under which conditions our algorithms identify real mergers and therefore avoid false substructures identifications in real catalogs.
Our uniform samples allow us to study the DM properties using kinematical analysis combined with X-ray observations and Weak Lensing mass reconstruccion (currently under way)
